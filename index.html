    <h1> javascript execution Context</h1>
    <p>javascript execution Context means how does code get execute in a js/ bhow your js file will get executed. for this js runs ur progrm in 2 phases </p>
 
    <h1> in 2 phases execution of js occurs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory creation phase / creation phase : spaces r allocated to the variable here these are not executed</li>
        <li>Execution Phase : execution occurs here</li>
    </ul> 

    <img src="./images/2.jpg" alt="" srcset="">
    <h3>whenever we give a code to js GEC is formed as sure{} ----> global execution context-- this </h3>
    <p>As per the environment (browser/node environment) the value of this is different. in browser object the value of this is window object.</p>
    <h1>Types of execution context</h1>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Global execution/environment Context ; represented by "this",. "this"  will there</li>
        <li>Function execution Context</li>
        <li>Eval execution Context : this is the property of global object</li>
        
    </ul>

    <h3> for the function nothing will happen as it is already defined </h3>
    <p>for addNum new memory phase and execution phase is developed. note:- jitnni bar ye function execute hotay hai utni bar new memory phase and execution phase banta hai</p>
    <p>let result1 = addNum(val1, val2); we have to see for the function otherwise mistake happens;</p>
    <pre> function addNum(num1, num2) {
        let total = num1 + num2
        return total //total after execution from function is returned to GEC after return the formed memory an dexecution phase is deleted see in fig below
    }</pre>

        <p>
            In JavaScript, both `null` and `undefined` are special values used to represent the absence of a meaningful value. However, they are used in slightly different contexts and have some distinctions:

1. `undefined`:
   - `undefined` is a primitive data type in JavaScript.
   - A variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value automatically has the value `undefined`. For example:

   ```javascript
   let x;
   console.log(x); // Outputs: undefined
   ```

   - Function parameters that have not been provided with an argument also have the value `undefined`.

   ```javascript
   function example(a) {
       console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined
   }
   example();
   ```

   - It can also occur as the return value of a function that does not explicitly return anything.

   ```javascript
   function doSomething() {}
   let result = doSomething();
   console.log(result); // Outputs: undefined
   ```

2. `null`:
   - `null` is an intentional value that represents the absence of any object or value. It is often used to indicate that a variable should be empty or not pointing to any object.
   - Unlike `undefined`, `null` is explicitly assigned to a variable.

   ```javascript
   let y = null;
   console.log(y); // Outputs: null
   ```

   - It can be used to reset or clear a variable that previously held an object or value.

   ```javascript
   let data = getDataFromAPI();
   // After using the data, you may want to clear it:
   data = null;
   ```

   - `null` is not the same as an empty object, an empty array, or a non-existent property. It represents the absence of any object or value.

In summary, `undefined` is often the default value for uninitialized variables and function parameters, while `null` is typically used to explicitly indicate the absence of a value or to reset a variable that previously held a value. Understanding when and how to use them is important for writing clean and error-free JavaScript code.
