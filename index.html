    <h1> javascript execution Context</h1>
    <p>javascript execution Context means how does code get execute in a js/ bhow your js file will get executed. for this js runs ur progrm in 2 phases </p>
 
    <h1> in 2 phases execution of js occurs</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Memory creation phase / creation phase : spaces r allocated to the variable here these are not executed</li>
        <li>Execution Phase : execution occurs here</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>whenever we give a code to js GEC is formed as sure{} ----> global execution context-- this </h3>
    <p>As per the environment (browser/node environment) the value of this is different. in browser object the value of this is window object.</p>
    <h1>Types of execution context</h1>
    <ul>
        
        <li>Global execution/environment Context ; represented by "this",. "this"  will there</li>
        <li>Function execution Context</li>
        <li>Eval execution Context : this is the property of global object</li>
        
    </ul>

        let val1 = 10;
        let val2 = 5;
        function addNum(num1, num2) {
            let total = num1 + num2
            return total
        }
        let result1 = addNum(val1, val2);
        let result2 = addNum(12,52)

    <h3> for the function nothing will happen as it is already defined </h3>
    <p>for addNum new memory phase and execution phase is developed. note:- jitnni bar ye function execute hotay hai utni bar new memory phase and execution phase banta hai</p>
    <p>let result1 = addNum(val1, val2); we have to see for the function otherwise mistake happens;</p>
    <pre> function addNum(num1, num2) {
        let total = num1 + num2
        return total //total after execution from function is returned to GEC after return the formed memory an dexecution phase is deleted see in fig below
    }</pre>

    <h3>for result2 also same will happen</h3>
